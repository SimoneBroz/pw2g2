# pw2gw

This is a guide to perform optical properties calculation using the pw2gw.x code of the PP package of Quantum Espresso

### Overview

In this tutoria we will see how to use the pw2gw.x code to perform optical properties calculation for different systems. We will focus on systems with different dimensionalities:
- 1D system: Germanium cluster
- 2D system: Graphene
- 3D system: Bulk silicon
